# Basic-Assembly-Project
This repository contains assembly programs implemented for the Mano Basic Computer. The programs focus on array manipulation, clipping values within a specific range, and performing multiplication operations using assembly language tailored for the Mano Basic Computer architecture.

## Array Copy and Clipping Program

The first program in this repository aims to copy ArrayA to ArrayB in the RAM memory of the Mano Basic Computer. During the copying process, the program clips values between 100 and 200 to maintain updated values in ArrayB.

## Two Arrays Multiplication Program

Another program in this repository is built around a subroutine (function) designed to perform individual multiplications of two 4-bit numbers. The subroutine takes inputs A and B, adding A to itself B times.
